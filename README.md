# Background
Design, develop and simulate a spacecraft propelled by electric propulsion methods, with payload integration. Showcase a deep understanding of spacecraft structures, payload integration, propulsion systems and orbital manuevers through guidance, navigation and control (GNC) techniques. 

# 1. Objective
Design and simulate a CubeSat mission that incorporates electric propulsion for orbital maneuvers and integrates a camera and sensors as the payload. Utilize software programs such as C++, MATLAB, and GMAT for orbital simulation and system analysis. A Model Based Systems Engineering (MSBSE) approach will be adopted here. 

# 2. Deliverables 
## 2.1 Spacecraft Design 
- CubeSat design principles, standards, constraints (e.g CubeSat design specification, CubeSat Kit docuemntation)
- Desired mission objectives such as earth observation, remote sensing
- Select appropriate CubeSat form factor and establish system mrequirements (mass, power, data rates etc). Background in aerospace structures and mechanics is useful here. 
- Design of satellite' structure, subsystems (power, communication, thermal control etc.) and interfaces 

## 2.2 Electric Propulsion Integration 
- Research and select which EP system will be suitable for a CubeSat mission (e.g Hall Effect thruster, gridded ion thruster etc.)
- Design of propulsion susbsyte,, considering factors such as power requirements, propellant storage, thruster integration 
- Analyze and simulate propulsion system's performance using C++, or MATLAB. Model thrust profiles, power consumption, and orbital manuevers

## Payload Integration 
- Choose and evaluate payload components in the mission. Identify specific camera and sensors to be integrated into the CubeSat payload. 
- Design the payload subsystem, including power supply, data interfaces and mechanical integration. 
- Develop software interfaces and algorithms to control and operate the camera and sensors effectively. 

## Orbital Simulation 
- Use GMAT to simulate CubeSat's orbit and mission dynamics. STK package offered by ANSYS can also be used. 
- Define the initial orbital paramters (altitude, inclination, eccentricity) and mission scenario (launch, deployment, maneuvers) 
- Analyze and optimze electric propulsion system's usage for orbital maneuvers, such as orbit raising, station-keeping or orbit transfer. 

## System Integration and Testing 
- Integration of all subsytems (propulsion, payload, communication etc.) into a cohesive CubeSat design 
- Develop software programs (C++, MATLAB) to control, monitor and analyze the CubeSat's operation and telemetry
- Conduct software-in-the-loop (SIL) testing and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations to validate system's performance and functionality

## Performance Evaluation 
- Analyze and evaluate CubeSat's performance based on various metrics including power consumption, data transmission rates, payload image quality and orbital stabilty. 
- Compare the simulated results with the initial design requiretns and make iterative improvements as necessary.

# Report 
The whole design, buid, development, and simulation analysis and results are recorded using Jupyter Notebook. This contains a detailed text describing project background, all necessary theory and ongoing progress. Any research done on mission requirements, tradeoff studies and mission parameter evaluations will also be recorded on this notebook.
A comprehensive documentation will be created detailing the cubesat design, subsystem specifications, simulation methodology and analysis results.
